# GEN Third Party Libraries

**GEN FrameWork** uses several third-party libraries for part of its functionality that it offers. These libraries should only be present if some features of **GEN FrameWork** are used.

It is convenient that these libraries are organized in a directory and have the appropriate versions of them, although this location can be organized where necessary by changing the project files.

The suggested default organization and directory is:

**ThirdPartyLibraries struct (Default)** 
    
    GENFramework/ThirdPartyLibraries/
	 zlib  
     libpng  
     jpeglib  
     lua  
     ...  
     (rest of directories)  
    

The project files of the included applications of TEST (GENFrameWork/Tests) and GEN UTILS (GENFrameWork/Utils) refer to that default directory.

These libraries can be downloaded from the Internet because their use is public and free.

Next, you have a list of the libraries used with:
- Installation directory (suggested by default).
- Version used by GEN.
- URL of the creator.
- Download URL (if applicable)
- Additional comments for your configuration.

Additionally, to facilitate the use of FrameWork GEN you have available this download URL in which in a single compressed file is all the contents of this directory:
